        <h2>There's a ghost cat in the capitol</h2>
        <p>In the Supreme Court chamber inside the Capitol, there are cat paw prints just outside the door. The floor was set before it arrived at the U.S. Capitol, so no one knows where they really came from, but legend tells of a ghost cat lingering.</p>
